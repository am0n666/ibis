# ibis UI

This repository provides a simple web interface in PHP for running the
[ibis-next](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/ibis-next) command line tool.
Upload a zipped collection of markdown files and edit the `ibis.php` configuration
before generating your eBook in PDF, EPUB, or HTML format. The interface uses
Bootstrap for basic styling and assumes the `ibis-next` binary is available in
the system `PATH`.
