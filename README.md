# ibis UI

This repository provides a minimal web interface in PHP for running the
[ibis-next](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/ibis-next) command line tool.
Upload a zipped collection of markdown files and choose the desired
output format. The script expects the `ibis-next` binary to be available
in the system `PATH`.
